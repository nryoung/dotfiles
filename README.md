# dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles! I have commenced on a journey to switch all of my tooling to either no-config or minimal config solutions. So, of course, in antithesis of that I have converted everything to a Nix flake config. The reasoning behind this is two fold. One, I truly wanted a config that would work in Linux exactly like it does in MacOS. Two, I want all of the little quirks of my setup to be codified so I never have to remember how to do it again (looking at you capslock remap). Also, switching to a Nix flake gives me the added benefit of being able to easily rollback any config changes to a previous state quite easily. Also also, it gives me flexibility to try new setups and tools quickly without trashing the config of my system.

All that being said, below you will find the list of tools and programs that I use and the corresponding article explaining how I use that tool.

_Warning_: I am not an expert with Nix flakes or any of the aformentioned tools, so use my setup at your own risk.
